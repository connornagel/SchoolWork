Python Eval
--------------------------------------
Python seems much more literal than java. I like the syntax of for loops involving 'in' because it will automatically loop through each element in the dictionary instead of needing to know the number of elements ahead of looping. The use of indentation for creating code blocks made formatting and reading the code much easier too.
